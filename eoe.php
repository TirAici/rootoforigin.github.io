<h2> Edge of Exile </h2>
<img src="images/Symbol copy.png" alt="Edge of Exiles Tower Splash" style="float:left;width:170px;height:170px;"/>
<p> “Yes, indeed...
It is a damned place that no longer bears any name. An orphan to all known kingdoms. A dark tower shrouded in mystery. Built in the transitory land where those banished and cast aside converge. In venturing this far beyond known borders, those exiles discover the truth behind omens long forgotten, memories of those whose footprints are now worn smooth by the unerring march of time. The land itself, feral and untamed, seems to rise up, protesting at the ambitions of foreign minds. Even within the blackstone spire unseen bells toll, stirring a deep madness from its core. And so it would seem that those outcasts now realise they stand at an uncertain precipice, that they stand - upon the Edge of Exile.”</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Current Characters</h2>
<ul class="columnsgroup">
	<li><h3>Aedric Godsford</h3>
<h3>Human - Martial Mechanist</h3>
<p>Bald and bold, with a viking like beard. Often seen in combat with his trusty longsword in one hand and a vial of some sort in the other. The second son of the noble house of Godsford exiled for his part in failing to protect his elder brother. Aedric is a man favoring quick decisive action but is not so rash as to dive into anything head first.</p>
	</li>
	<p></p>
	<li><h3>Claus Daubeny</h3>
<h3>Human - Stray Zealot</h3>
<p>Cowardly yet heroic. Claus is a weedy young man with foppish blonde hair. In battle he wields a spear in one hand and a buckler in the other, as well as ill fitting chainmail over which his tabard lies. From a young age he was raised by monks to be the "chosen one". Despite his general cowardice and unreadyness in most matters both spiritual and practical, he is actually a force for good, throwing himself in harm's way to save others without hesitation.</p>
	</li>
<p></p>
<br/>
	<li><h3>Gaius Zantori</h3>
<h3>Human - Errant Knight</h3>
<p>Stoic and Resolute. Standing taller than most and built like an ox, Gaius is a man who values honor and good conduct above all else, even his own life. In combat and bedecked in his armour he wields his halberd with deadly and versatile precision. Recently released from the service of a family he had come to see as his own, he is still finding his place in an unwelcoming world.</p>
	</li>
		<p></p>
	<li><h3>Theodwyn Vor Sarrona</h3>
<h3>High Elf - Sanguine Scholar</h3>
<p>Pragmatic and resourceful. Theo is a lean high elf with long blonde hair. Almost never seen out of his dressing gown-like robes or without a piping hot teacup close at hand. Once a slave, now no longer he spends his day acquiring knowledge and scheming to unknown ends. As a mage he specializes in controlling the flow of the fight rather than outright damage. It is unclear what he values most in life, knowledge or tea.</p>
